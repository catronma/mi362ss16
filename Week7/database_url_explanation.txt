Week 7 database URL.  The database shows up in my heroku app on my account now but the console didn't give me a specific URL.  When I went into the db in the app it said the URL was:  postgres://rswdjlwpnljqpr:-I21fxbFBNmg-sCUEmMlZp7xIC@ec2-54-197-230-210.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/de46eusr1m0j14 However, when you try and visit that, it will not work.  I also tried just the URL for the app with a "/db" on the end and receive the error "cannot GET /db"
