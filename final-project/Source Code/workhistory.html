<h2>Work History</h2>
<p>I have been fortunate to be able to see and do many diffeent things during my adult working life.  To include traveling to may countries such as Germany, Austria, France, Netherlands and Belgium.  I have also had to move alot during my service in the U.S. Army to several different states such as Missouri, Colorado, Kansas and Virginia.  However, I am now ready to move on to learn new things.  Below is a general, but not an all inclusive list:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Farm Hand/student till 2000</li>
    <li>U.S. Army (2000 – 2005)</li>
    <li>Self Employed (2006 – Present)</li>
</ol>

<p>While I was attending MSU the first time, I worked on a cash crop farm with my brother-in-law both during the school year as well as the summers.</p>
<p>I entered the U.S. Army in August of 2000.  The decision was made to join the Army due to my $40K in student loans staring me in the face and at the time, the Army had just started a student loan re-payment program where they pay 1/3 of your loans for every active year you serve for up to $60K in loans.  It was during that time that I was able to do al the traveling mentioned above.</p>

<p>After leaving the Army in 2005, my wife and I started an online candle business called <a href= "http://mandleco.com" target=”_blank”>Mandleco</a> which is just a small candle business that focuses on candle scents for men.  The scents are somewhat of a novelty such as campfire smoke, wood shop, and auto shop.  We continue to run this business today and plan on trying to grow it while possible developing additional online business ideas.</p>
