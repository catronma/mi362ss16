<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I graduated with a B.S. in Fisheries and Wildlife management in 2000 from Michigan State University and now I am back again using my Post 9/11 GI Bill to obtain a degree in Media Informtion and Technology.  Below is a list of the schools I have attended (not including military schools):</p>

<ol>
	<li>Washtenaw Community College</li>
  <li>Eastern Michigan University</li>
  <li>Michigan State University</li>
</ol>

<p>I took only basic classes at Wahstenaw Community College because I still wasn't sure what i wanted to do as a major.  I went to Eastern Michigan University as well with the intention of obtaining a construction management degree but then changed my mind.  I then decided to commit to MSU to obtain a B.S. in Fisheries and Wildlife Management.  I will be graduating again in May 2016 form the College of Communication Arts and Sciences.</p>
